# CodeCoverage_Mock
Mocking up a static code coverage dashboard

## Business Value

### Value
Having code covered by automated unit testing is a key in many regards to modern software development. It enables developers to refactor code, removing technical debt on a product, while staying confident they arn't breaking existing functionality. It improves security complaiance with ITSG-33 SA-11(8), enabling developers to get though security testing faster. It reduces the amount of manual testing required, enabling developers to spend less time in testing cycles. Having a high code coverage is one of the first steps towards being able to implement Continous Delivery with a product.

### Purpous
We want to identify teams that have been successfull in increasing the code coverage of their products to enable them in taking further steps to reach Continous Delivery. We also want to identify teams that are struggling to increase code coverage so issues can be identified and have support provided to bring those products to the same level as the rest of the products.

### Method
We want to create a dashborad where all products are listed along with current code coverage. This dashboard will be avaliable for any employee to view the status of any product listed.
